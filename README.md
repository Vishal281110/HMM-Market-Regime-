# Market Regimes Classification Using Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

Classifying hidden market regimes (bullish, bearish, volatile) using Hidden Markov Models on financial time-series data to enable adaptive trading strategies and improved risk management.


## Overview

Financial markets often move through different regimes such as bullish, bearish, volatile, or sideways phases. Identifying these regimes is crucial for building adaptive trading strategies and effective risk management. However, market regimes are not directly observable and can change dynamically over time.

This project addresses the problem by using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to classify hidden market states based on historical stock time-series data, such as returns and volatility. HMM treats market behavior as a probabilistic state machine where the underlying regimes are hidden, and the observed financial metrics serve as emissions.

By training unsupervised HMMs, the project:

1. Detects hidden regimes without prior labeling

2. Visualizes regime transitions and probabilities

3. Backtests regime-specific trading strategies

4. Predicts future regime probabilities using Viterbi decoding and filtering

The outcome is a framework that can help traders, analysts, and researchers gain deeper insights into market dynamics and build data-driven, regime-aware strategies.
